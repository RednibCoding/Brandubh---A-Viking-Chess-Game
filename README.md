# Brandubh

## Introduction

Brandubh is the smallest member of the Tafl family of games. Its name means Black Raven in
Gaelic (Irish), and it is known to have been played in Ireland at least a thousand years ago.
Despite its small size, it is a tricky and interesting game, though short, and is quick to learn but
difficult to master. It is played on a 7 x 7 board, with the corners and centre square marked these
are special squares.


## The Aim of the Game

The two players have different aims in the game:

- The white player wins by moving the king piece to any corner square.
- The black player wins by capturing the white king.

## The Pieces

The two players have different forces to work with:

- White has a king and 4 warriors.
- Black has no king, but 8 warriors.

Starting Position:

## Movement of the pieces

All the pieces including the king move the same way in straight lines forward, backwards, left or
right, any number of squares. It's like the way rooks (or castles) move in chess. No piece may
move diagonally or jump over another piece, and no more than one piece may occupy a square

## Capturing Pieces

You can capture an enemy warrior by surrounding it on
both sides with two of your own warriors. They must be
standing on opposite sides, either in front and behind, or
to the left and right, not diagonally.
A piece that becomes trapped like this by an enemy move
is captured and removed from the board. However, it is
safe to move into a gap between two enemies without
being captured. The King may participate in capturing,
just like any other piece, and he may also be captured
just like any other piece. It is possible to capture more
than one piece at a time, but not if they are standing
together in a row.

As shown in the picture, black
would capture two white pieces
at once when he moves to the
left.

## Special Squares

The central square <img src="/assets/pics/raw/king_square.png" /> (known as the throne square because the king sits there at the
start of the game) and the four corner squares are restricted. Only the king may occupy any of
these five squares, though any warrior may pass through the throne square when it is empty,
without stopping on it. The king may return to the throne square after he has left it, if required.
The king can be captured while on the throne, just the same as on any other square, by being
surrounded on two opposite sides.
In addition, the four corner squares <img src="/assets/pics/raw/corner_square.png" /> (but not the throne square) are hostile squares.
This means that they can play the part of an enemy warrior of either colour for the purposes of
capturing.

Any piece, including the king, that is occupying a square
next to the corner square, can be captured if an enemy
piece moves in behind it, trapping it against the hostile
corner square.

In this example, white has captured the black piece in his
move because the black piece is trapped between a
corner square and the white piece. This rule applies to
either colour.
